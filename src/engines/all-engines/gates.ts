// Nothing here is approved. Until a reviewer's sign-off is recorded
// (`npm run compliance -- approve …`):
//  - every client-facing sentence of a practice-area pack renders as a visible
//    "[PENDING ATTORNEY REVIEW …]" placeholder via legalCopy();
//  - every Texas family-law rule reference, every Immigration rule reference
//    and every Texas personal-injury rule reference blocks (requireApproval
//    throws PendingApprovalError) in whichever engine tries to apply it.
// Drafts are proposals for the reviewer, not approved wording and not legal
// advice. Shared gates (rules.court_deadlines, rules.limitation_periods,
// rules.fee_agreement_terms, rules.trust_accounting) are reused, not redefined.
